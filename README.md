# Mandelbrot.jl
Plots the Mandelbrot set for various seed polynomials. 
Let f(z) be the seed polynomial with constant term c.
Plots the convergence of the sequence f(0), f(f(0)), f(f(f(0))), ...


If this sequence converges for a particular value of c, that point in the complex plane is colored red and blue otherwise.
